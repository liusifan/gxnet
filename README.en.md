Implementing a Toy-Level Neural Network Training Framework from Scratch in C++

The idea for this project comes from the book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) . The book demonstrates a neural network with less than 100 lines of Python code achieving over 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, which is quite surprising. It gave me the idea to implement a toy-level neural network training framework from scratch in C++. I have spent a few weekends recently and have achieved the goal.
