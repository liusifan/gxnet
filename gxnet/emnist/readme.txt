The original dataset has a total of 372451 data items. The train and test datasets are selected from the handwritten dataset.

The test dataset is selected by first, and up to 300 items for each label. And then the train dataset is selected, up to 10000 items for each label. Since there are not enough items for each label in the original dataset, the amount of items for train and test are less than expected.
